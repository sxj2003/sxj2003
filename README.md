# About me 👋
Hi! I am a first-year Master's student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, advised by Prof. Peter Bradley Shull. I am a member of the Wearable System Lab.

🔭 My current research involves **motion detection algorithms based on wearable sensors**, primarily focusing on golf movements.

🌱 I’m currently learning **machine learning algorithms for robot control**.I am particularly interested in **robot manipulation based on vision-tactile sensing**. I believe that dexterous manipulation is a foundational skill that robots must master early on. My goal is to develop excellent control algorithms for dexterous hands to enable robots to integrate into all aspects of people's lives.

📫 How to reach me: sxj2003@sjtu.edu.cn.

⚡ Outside of my academic life, I enjoy **photography, hiking and camping**.
